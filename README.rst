-------------------------------
ðŸš€ Getting Started
-------------------------------

To get started with this project, ensure you have `Poetry` installed. If you don't have Poetry, install it using:

.. code-block:: sh

   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

   pip install poetry

After installing Poetry, set up the project dependencies by running:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry install

This will create a virtual environment and install all required dependencies.

This project includes a **'poetry.lock'** file, ensuring that all dependencies are 
installed exactly as specified.

To set up the project, simply run:
.. code-block:: sh
poetry install

This will:
- install all dependencies exactly as locked in **'poetry.lock'**, ensuring consistency.
- Automatically create a virtual environment (unless Poetry is set to use the system interpreter).

-------------------------------
ðŸ”§ Running the Project
-------------------------------

Activate the Poetry environment and start using the project:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry shell

To run the application:

.. code-block:: sh

   poetry run python manage.py runserver

*(Navigate to the UnivyxApi Folder first before running this.)*
